### What does this app do?

This app promotes studying by helping users memorize new words.
Once you log in the app, you can make your own flashcards that contains not only words and their corresponding meanings but also your own example sentences and comments.
Besides, the feature to shuffle cards enables your brain learn effectively!
As a language learner, I'm also a frequent user of this app :)
