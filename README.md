## ** ABOUT **

This app promotes studying by helping users memorize new words.
Once you log in the app, you can make your own flashcards that contains not only words and their corresponding meanings but also your own example sentences and comments.
Besides, the feature to shuffle cards enables your brain learn effectively!
As a language learner, I'm also a frequent user of this app :)

### The aim of this project

On this project, I aimed to deep-understand how to work with React Hooks such as State Hook and Effect Hook, and also Context API so that I would feel comfortable in managing state in the app. Another thing that I focused on was creating REST API and connecting the app with database, which was such a valuable experience for me to care about both frontend and backend.

### Some of the challenges I faced through this project

I found it really tough to expect what's happening after every render, especially when I try to let React know what the component needs to do after render. It took me a lot of time to understand how to handle side effects and get components to be rendered in the way as I want to do.
